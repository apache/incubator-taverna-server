<h1>Taverna Server %{VERSION}</h1>
<p>For a full list of operations, see the <a
    href="%{BASEURL}/services">service listing</a> generated by Apache
CXF, which indicates where to access the WSDL and WADL descriptions of
the T2Server interface.</p>
<p>What follows below is a simple guide to using the server. It does
<i>not</i> cover all the features; a much more extensive guide is available on
<a href="http://www.mygrid.org.uk/dev/wiki/display/taverna/Taverna+Server+2.4"
>the myGrid website</a>.</p>
<h2>5 Minute Guide to Using the REST API</h2>
<p>Taverna Server %{VERSION} supports both REST and SOAP APIs; you may use either API
to access the service and any of the workflow runs hosted by the service. This
simple guide just discusses the REST API.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
  <p>The client starts by creating a workflow run. This is done by POSTing a
  T2flow document to the service at the address <tt>%{BASEURL}/rest/runs</tt>
  with the content type <tt>application/vnd.taverna.t2flow+xml</tt>.</p>
  <p>The result of the POST is an <tt>HTTP 201 Created</tt> that gives the
  location of the created run (in a <tt>Location</tt> header),
  <tt>%{BASEURL}/rest/runs/<b>UUID</b></tt> (where <tt><b>UUID</b></tt> is a
  unique string that identifies the particular run; this is also the name of
  the run that you would use in the SOAP interface). Note that the run is not
  yet actually doing anything.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Next, you need to set up the inputs to the workflow ports. To set the
  input port, <tt><b>FOO</b></tt>, to have the value <tt><b>BAR</b></tt>, you
  would PUT a message like this to the URI
  <tt>%{BASEURL}/rest/runs/<b>UUID</b>/input/input/<b>FOO</b></tt>
  </p>
  <blockquote><pre>&lt;t2sr:runInput xmlns:t2sr=&quot;http://ns.taverna.org.uk/2010/xml/server/rest/&quot;&gt;
    &lt;t2sr:value&gt;<b>BAR</b>&lt;/t2sr:value&gt;
&lt;/t2sr:runInput&gt;</pre></blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Now you can start the file running. This is done by using a PUT to set
  <tt>%{BASEURL}/rest/runs/<b>UUID</b>/status</tt> to the plain text value
  <tt>Operating</tt>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Now you need to poll, waiting for the workflow to finish. To discover the
  state of a run, you can (at any time) do a GET on
  <tt>%{BASEURL}/rest/runs/<b>UUID</b>/status</tt>; when the workflow has
  finished executing, this will return <tt>Finished</tt> instead of
  <tt>Operating</tt> (or <tt>Initialized</tt>, the starting state).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Every workflow run has an expiry time, after which it will be destroyed
  and all resources (i.e., local files) associated with it cleaned up. By
  default in this release, this is 20 minutes after initial creation. To see
  when a particular run is scheduled to be disposed of, do a GET on
  <tt>%{BASEURL}/rest/runs/<b>UUID</b>/expiry</tt>; you may set the time when
  the run is disposed of by PUTting a new time to that same URI. Note that
  this includes not just the time when the workflow is executing, but also
  when the input files are being created beforehand and when the results are
  being downloaded afterwards; you are advised to make your clients regularly
  advance the expiry time while the run is in use.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>The outputs from the workflow are files created in the <tt>out</tt>
  subdirectory of the run's working directory. The contents of the
  subdirectory can be read by doing a GET on
  <tt>%{BASEURL}/rest/runs/<b>UUID</b>/wd/out</tt> which will return an XML
  document describing the contents of the directory, with links to each of the
  files within it. Doing a GET on those links will retrieve the actual created
  files (as uninterpreted binary data).</p>
  <p>Thus, if a single output <tt><b>FOO.OUT</b></tt> was produced from the
  workflow, it would be written to the file that can be retrieved from
  <tt>%{BASEURL}/rest/runs/<b>UUID</b>/wd/out/<b>FOO.OUT</b></tt> and the
  result of the GET on <tt>%{BASEURL}/rest/runs/<b>UUID</b>/wd/out</tt> would
  look something like this:</p>
  <blockquote><pre>&lt;t2sr:directoryContents xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
        xmlns:t2sr="http://ns.taverna.org.uk/2010/xml/server/rest"
        xmlns:t2s="http://ns.taverna.org.uk/2010/xml/server/"&gt;
    &lt;t2s:file xlink:href="%{BASEURL}/rest/runs/<b>UUID</b>/wd/out/<b>FOO.OUT</b>"
            t2sr:name="<b>FOO.OUT</b>"&gt;out/<b>FOO.OUT</b>&lt;/t2s:file&gt;
&lt;/t2sr:directoryContents&gt;</pre></blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>The standard output and standard error from the T2 Command Line Executor
  subprocess can be read via properties of the special I/O listener. To do
  that, do a GET on
  <tt>%{BASEURL}/rest/runs/<b>UUID</b>/listeners/io/properties/<b>stdout</b></tt>
  (or <tt>.../<b>stderr</b></tt>). Once the subprocess has finished executing,
  the I/O listener will provide a third property containing the exit code of
  the subprocess, called <tt>exitcode</tt>.</p> <p>Note that the supported set
  of listeners and properties will be subject to change in future versions of
  the server, and should not be relied upon.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Once you have finished, destroy the run by doing a DELETE on
  <tt>%{BASEURL}/rest/runs/<b>UUID</b></tt>. Once you have done that, none of
  the resources associated with the run (including both input and output
  files) will exist any more. If the run is still executing, this will also
  cause it to be stopped.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>All operations described above have equivalents in the
<a href="%{BASEURL}/soap?wsdl">SOAP service interface</a>.</p>
